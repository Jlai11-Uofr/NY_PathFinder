# NY_PathFinder
Finds Shortest Paths in miles between any two points in University of Rochester, Monroe County, and New York State


This is a Visual Representation of the Path Finding Algorithm Dijkstra's algorithm.

Given a constructed Graph of edges as path and Nodes are locations/Intersections.

Using Inputs of two Nodes. This Project will provide step by step directions of how to get to a location from a starting point.

As well as it was will visually represent it. On a Map Generated specifically to the current dataset.
